Mod Description:
    Provides reverse recipes for craftable metal items (i.e. enables you to smelt the 
    item back in to ingots). Provides the correct quantity of the most valuable ingot
    type (based on quantity x value). The mod depends upon PRUFEI (Protection for 
    Recipes Using Favorite and Equipped Items) in order to prevent smelting of favorite
    and equipped items.

Important version for end users:
    If you are using version 0.9.2 or earlier you do not need to upgrade and should not
    do so. The main reason for the 0.9.3 upgrade is to remove the dependency on the
    Unofficial Skyrim patches.

Dependencies:
    PRUFEI (if NOT using the all-in-one version)
    The Skyrim Script Extender (SKSE)
    
Installation:
    Install SKSE from https://skse.silverlock.org/ using Vortex or another mod manager
    Install PRUFEI (if NOT using the all-in-one version) using Vortex or another mod manager
    Install Elementary Smelting using Vortex or another mod manager
